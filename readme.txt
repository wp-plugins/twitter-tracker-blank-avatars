== Description ==

Provides a small blank image from your server in place of the avatars used by the [Twitter Tracker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tracker/) widgets, avoiding Twitter cookies. This is inline with new directives from the UK government to reduce unnecessary cookie usage, following European legislation on this subject.

Use this Twitter Tracker partner plugin if you are hiding the avatars in your Twitter widget with CSS or you are not bothered with showing the Twitter avatars in your widgets. If you want to show the avatars, and want to avoid having Twitter drop cookies on your visitors, then the [Twitter Tracker Avatar Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tracker-avatar-cache/) partner plugin will be a better option for you.

== Installation ==


The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download `twitter-tracker-blank-avatars.zip`
1. Unzip
1. Upload `twitter-tracker-blank-avatars` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins` directory
1. Go to the plugin management page and enable the plugin
1. Give yourself a pat on the back
